    I am a motivated researcher with expertise in Quantum Software Testing. My goal is to advance
    the understanding and development of testability in Quantum Software and Hybrid
    Quantum-Classical systems. My research focuses on Quantum Software Testability, Formal
    Verification, Quantum Information Theory, and the design of testing frameworks for emerging
    quantum-classical architectures.
