  type: text
  contents:
    - I am a motivated researcher with expertise in Quantum Software Testing. My goal is to advance the understanding and development of testability in Quantum Software and Hybrid Quantum-Classical systems. My work focuses on Quantum Software Testability, Formal Verification, Quantum Information Theory, and the design of testing frameworks for emerging quantum-classical architectures.
