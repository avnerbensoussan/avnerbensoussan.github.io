## 🌿 Hobbies — Life Beyond Research

Outside of research, I invest time in activities that cultivate **discipline, curiosity, endurance, and collective creativity**—values that strongly resonate with my academic work.

I sing weekly with **<a href="https://zinnechoeur.be" target="_blank">Zinnechoeur</a>**, an a cappella choir of **32 wonderfully diverse singers**. Guided by an inspiring conductor, we explore demanding and expressive vocal repertoires, building something meaningful through listening, balance, and collective effort.

Endurance sports play a central role in my routine. **Triathlon** brings rigor and structure to my weeks through training, and to my years through long-term goals, races, and challenges. It provides a steady framework that supports both physical resilience and mental focus.

During summers, I turn to **bikepacking** as a way of traveling: slow, self-supported journeys that offer freedom, simplicity, and a close connection to landscapes and people. Complementing this, **hiking and backpacking** take me to remote and beautiful places around the world, offering immersion in nature to balance the year working in the lab on my research.
