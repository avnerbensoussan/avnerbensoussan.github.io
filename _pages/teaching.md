## 🏫 Summer School Presentation — ITU Copenhagen

I presented my work on **faults in hybrid quantum-classical architectures** at the **PICS Summer School** hosted by the **IT University of Copenhagen**.  
The presentation was based on our taxonomy of real faults observed in quantum-classical systems.
