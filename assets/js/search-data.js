The energy, diversity, and depth of ideas exchanged were simply inspiring.💡 The week was filled with outstanding talks, thought-provoking discussions, and so many opportunities to connect with brilliant minds from across the programming languages and software engineering communities. It was truly a celebration of innovation at the intersection of theory and practice.⚛️ I was particularly pleasantly impressed by the Quantum session, where I had the honor to present our two papers published at OOPSLA:👉 AccelerQ: Accelerating Quantum Eigensolvers with Machine Learning on Quantum Simulatorshttps://lnkd.in/eTPP9YcD👉 Shaking Up Quantum Simulators with Fuzzing and Rigourhttps://lnkd.in/eDCgaG-nIt was incredibly rewarding to share our work and engage in deep discussions about the future of quantum software testing and hybrid quantum-classical computation.🌇 Beyond the conference, Singapore was absolutely stunning — from the breathtaking Marina Bay skyline to the amazing diversity of food across hawker centres and the lively Lau Pa Sat atmosphere, every moment was a delight. And the visit to the gorgeous Orchid National Garden was the perfect way to unwind and appreciate the beauty of this vibrant city.🌍 Huge thanks to the organizers and all participants who made this conference such a memorable and intellectually stimulating experience. Looking forward to seeing how the dialogue between programming languages and quantum computing continues to grow!",

It&#39;s been a long and exciting journey, and I&#39;m thrilled to see our work recognized at this top venue.🔬 The first paper, AccelerQ: Accelerating Quantum Eigensolvers With Machine Learning on Quantum Simulators, reframes the challenge of tuning NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) algorithms as a hyperparameter optimization problem — opening the door for the software engineering and ML communities to engage with quantum algorithm optimisation in novel ways.🧪 The second, Shaking Up Quantum Simulators with Fuzzing and Rigour, introduces a powerful combination of fuzz testing and formal methods to systematically uncover bugs in quantum simulators — pushing for more reliable quantum software stacks.🌏 Looking forward to presenting both papers in Singapore and connecting with the amazing SPLASH/OOPSLA community.

You can read the paper here: https://lnkd.in/ehJnMsHx⛰️ The day was packed with brilliant talks, including an unforgettable keynote from Professor Sir Peter Knight, who reminded us that “we are in front of a triply exponentially scaling mountain, and we are going to climb it.” Couldn’t think of a better metaphor for what it feels like to work in quantum right now—challenging, but full of possibility.⚛️ Even more exciting is being part of King’s Quantum, a vibrant and growing team with amazing new researchers coming in.

The event featured an outstanding lineup of talks from both industry leaders and academic pioneers, highlighting breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum hardware, and cutting-edge theoretical research. The level of expertise shared was truly remarkable!One of the standout moments was the debate evening, held in the mythic Divinity Hall—a setting steeped in history that added even more weight to the discussions. Experts from both academia and industry engaged in thoughtful debates on the ethical implications, scalability, and societal impact of quantum technologies, bridging the gap between theory and real-world implementation.In addition to the stimulating talks, we were treated to a couple of sunny days, perfect for exploring the beautiful Oxford campus. The punting session on the River Cherwell was an absolute blast and a great opportunity to connect with fellow attendees in a more relaxed atmosphere.A huge thank you to the organizers, speakers, and attendees for making this such a memorable experience. The collaboration between academia and industry is accelerating the journey toward quantum advantage, and I’m excited to see where this transformative technology will lead us!",
