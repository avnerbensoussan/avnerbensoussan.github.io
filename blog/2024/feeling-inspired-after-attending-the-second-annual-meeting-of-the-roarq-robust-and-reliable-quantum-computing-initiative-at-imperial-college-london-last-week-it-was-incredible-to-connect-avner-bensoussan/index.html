✨ Feeling inspired after attending the second annual meeting of the RoaRQ (Robust and Reliable Quantum Computing) initiative at Imperial College London last week!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>🚀 It was incredible to connect with brilliant researchers from universities across the UK. Seeing the progress in quantum software testing and verification research was a true highlight.</p> <p>👩🎓 It was also great to catch up with colleagues from the early career researchers event held at Oxford a few months ago. This community continues to grow, and it’s exciting to be part of such impactful work.</p> <p>Check out the new beautiful website showcasing the initiative: https://lnkd.in/esmds6Ha 💻Great to see such progress, Avner Bensoussan!
