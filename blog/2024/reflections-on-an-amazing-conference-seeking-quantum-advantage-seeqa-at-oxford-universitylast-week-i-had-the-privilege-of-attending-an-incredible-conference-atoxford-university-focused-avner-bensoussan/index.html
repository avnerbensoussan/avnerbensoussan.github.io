🌟 Reflections on an Amazing Conference: Seeking Quantum Advantage (SeeQa) at Oxford University 🌟 Last week, I had the privilege of attending an incredible conference at Oxford University, focused on the pursuit of Quantum Advantage. The event featured an outstanding lineup of talks from both industry leaders and academic pioneers, highlighting breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum hardware, and cutting-edge theoretical research. The level of expertise shared was truly remarkable! One of the standout moments was the debate evening, held in the mythic Divinity Hall—a setting steeped in history that added even more weight to the discussions. Experts from both academia and industry engaged in thoughtful debates on the ethical implications, scalability, and societal impact of quantum technologies, bridging the gap between theory and real-world implementation. In addition to the stimulating talks, we were treated to a couple of sunny days, perfect for exploring the beautiful Oxford campus. The punting session on the River Cherwell was an absolute blast and a great opportunity to connect with fellow attendees in a more relaxed atmosphere. A huge thank you to the organizers, speakers, and attendees for making this such a memorable experience. The collaboration between academia and industry is accelerating the journey toward quantum advantage, and I’m excited to see where this transformative technology will lead us!Really amazing conference! Big thank you to the organizers! By a large margin this was the best location for a panel discussion ever.
