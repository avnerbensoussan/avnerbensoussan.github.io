🌍 What a fantastic week at the PICS 2024 Summer School at ITU Copenhagen, despite the not-so-summer weather!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>🎤 The speakers and the range of cutting-edge applications of probabilistic methods in theoretical computer science were truly inspiring. It’s remarkable how these techniques are advancing research across various fields.</p> <p>🖼 I presented my poster, A Taxonomy of Real Fault in Hybrid Quantum Classical Architectures, for the second time. It was fascinating to engage with a broader computer science audience after previously presenting to a quantum computing group at Oxford. The discussions were incredibly enriching!</p> <p>🤝 I also had the chance to connect with PhD students and researchers from around the world. Their fresh ideas and approaches were truly motivating, and it was rewarding to explore potential collaborations.</p> <p>✨ Proud to be part of this vibrant community, I return with fresh ideas and new perspectives for my research.</p> <p>🚀 Excited for continued growth and collaboration in this field!</p> <p>Learn more about the PICS 2024 school here: https://lnkd.in/ehdMHQrDSaliha Tokat, Jairo Miguel Marulanda-Giraldo, Hannah Mertens, Srajan Goyal, Henning Duwe, Christina Gehnen, Stefano Nicoletti, Roberto Pettinau Great to meet you all! Hope to see you soon at future Computer Science events :)What an incredible experience, Avner Bensoussan!The pleasure was on my side Avner Bensoussan! Great poster, I wish you the best of luck for your research !
