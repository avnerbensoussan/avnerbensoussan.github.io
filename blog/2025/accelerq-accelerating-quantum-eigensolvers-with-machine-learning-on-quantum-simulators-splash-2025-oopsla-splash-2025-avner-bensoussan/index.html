🙏 I'm honored to share that two of our papers have been accepted at OOPSLA 2025! It's been a long and exciting journey, and I'm thrilled to see our work recognized at this top venue.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>🔬 The first paper, AccelerQ: Accelerating Quantum Eigensolvers With Machine Learning on Quantum Simulators, reframes the challenge of tuning NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) algorithms as a hyperparameter optimization problem — opening the door for the software engineering and ML communities to engage with quantum algorithm optimisation in novel ways.</p> <p>🧪 The second, Shaking Up Quantum Simulators with Fuzzing and Rigour, introduces a powerful combination of fuzz testing and formal methods to systematically uncover bugs in quantum simulators — pushing for more reliable quantum software stacks.</p> <p>🌏 Looking forward to presenting both papers in Singapore and connecting with the amazing SPLASH/OOPSLA community. See you there!</p> <p>https://lnkd.in/eT6e5XPB</p> <p>https://lnkd.in/eEBaYW-TCongrats to you all : Vasileios, Karine, Sophie, Connor, Elena !
