✨ Had an amazing time at the King’s Quantum Annual Symposium today!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>📄 Super proud to have presented my poster on A Taxonomy of Real Faults in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architectures—a project that gathered and categorised real faults from online sources and expert interviews to better understand Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architectures as a software engineering paradigm, and to propose guidelines for building more robust and reliable hybrid systems. You can read the paper here: https://lnkd.in/ehJnMsHx</p> <p>⛰️ The day was packed with brilliant talks, including an unforgettable keynote from Professor Sir Peter Knight, who reminded us that “we are in front of a triply exponentially scaling mountain, and we are going to climb it.” Couldn’t think of a better metaphor for what it feels like to work in quantum right now—challenging, but full of possibility.</p> <p>⚛️ Even more exciting is being part of King’s Quantum, a vibrant and growing team with amazing new researchers coming in. The future looks bright—and weird, and entangled.</p> <p>📸 (Pic below from Peter Knight’s talk!)❤️ To view or add a comment, sign in</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        292 followers
