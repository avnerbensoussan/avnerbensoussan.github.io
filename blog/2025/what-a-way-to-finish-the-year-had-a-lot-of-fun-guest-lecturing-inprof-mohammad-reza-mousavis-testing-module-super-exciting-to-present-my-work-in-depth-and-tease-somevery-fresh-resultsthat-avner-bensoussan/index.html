</code></pre></div></div> <p>Had a lot of fun guest lecturing in Prof. Mohammad Reza Mousavi’s Testing Module. Super exciting to present my work in depth and tease some very fresh results that will be published soon 👀!</p> <p>Big thanks for the trust and guidance of my supervisors, and massive respect to the 3rd-year Bachelor and Master students for being there at the very end of the semester, in full exam-stress mode. I know the feeling — I was sitting exactly where you are a couple of years ago 😅</p> <p>If nothing else, I hope I at least kept you awake with some quality memes ☕📈</p> <p>Ending the year on a high note 🚀 To view or add a comment, sign in</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        261 followers
