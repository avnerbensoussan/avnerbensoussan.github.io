🎉 What an amazing week it was participating at ICFP/SPLASH 2025 — the first-ever joint edition of these two flagship SIGPLAN conferences, held in the vibrant city of Singapore! The energy, diversity, and depth of ideas exchanged were simply inspiring.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>💡 The week was filled with outstanding talks, thought-provoking discussions, and so many opportunities to connect with brilliant minds from across the programming languages and software engineering communities. It was truly a celebration of innovation at the intersection of theory and practice.</p> <p>⚛️ I was particularly pleasantly impressed by the Quantum session, where I had the honor to present our two papers published at OOPSLA:</p> <p>👉 AccelerQ: Accelerating Quantum Eigensolvers with Machine Learning on Quantum Simulators https://lnkd.in/eTPP9YcD 👉 Shaking Up Quantum Simulators with Fuzzing and Rigour https://lnkd.in/eDCgaG-n</p> <p>It was incredibly rewarding to share our work and engage in deep discussions about the future of quantum software testing and hybrid quantum-classical computation.</p> <p>🌇 Beyond the conference, Singapore was absolutely stunning — from the breathtaking Marina Bay skyline to the amazing diversity of food across hawker centres and the lively Lau Pa Sat atmosphere, every moment was a delight. And the visit to the gorgeous Orchid National Garden was the perfect way to unwind and appreciate the beauty of this vibrant city.</p> <p>🌍 Huge thanks to the organizers and all participants who made this conference such a memorable and intellectually stimulating experience. Looking forward to seeing how the dialogue between programming languages and quantum computing continues to grow!Great to meet you guys Amanda, Abtin, Adam! Hope to see you in the next event!Congratulations again to you all Karine, Vasileios, Sophie, Connor, Elena!</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    To view or add a comment, sign in
