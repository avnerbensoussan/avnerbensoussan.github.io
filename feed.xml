</code></pre></div></div> <p>🌱 This paper is more than a publication—it reflects how much I’ve learned about research and communication along the way.</p> <p>Good research is more than results When I started this project—the first of my PhD—I thought success meant getting the methods right and producing solid results. That alone took about a year. What I didn’t anticipate was that learning how to explain why those results mattered would take just as long. I presented this work in very different contexts: in Oxford to quantum physicists and chemists, in Copenhagen to non-quantum software researchers, and in Montpellier to quantum algorithms experts. In each community, a few people with very different backgrounds paused to bridge their perspective with this work. That led to rich discussions. The most fascinating part was aligning our vocabularies and finding shared ground. After each conference, I reshaped the paper with these new perspectives in mind. 💭 At one conference, I met a professor I deeply admire. We jumped straight into a technical discussion. She assumed I had a similar background—and I didn’t pause to explain that while our areas are related, we approach problems differently. She eventually walked away saying my work felt neither theoretical nor practical. That moment stuck with me. It was frustrating, unsettling, and honestly quite disorienting, but it now guides how I explain results.</p> <p>Quantum software research is about communication The same challenge appeared during the review process. No reviewer questioned the methodology or results. Instead, feedback focused on framing, context, and narrative. Comparing the first version with the current one—shaped by reviews and discussions—the difference is massive. 🔗 I realized this isn’t a secondary skill. In interdisciplinary fields like quantum computing, communication is part of the research itself. This is especially true for quantum software research: still underexplored, yet crucial for moving from lab-scale demonstrations to industrial pipelines and real-world use cases. Building that bridge isn’t just about better hardware or algorithms—it’s about elegant software that smartly connects the two, layers of abstraction, fault understanding, and, above all, a shared language across communities.</p> <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration drives innovation Working across quantum physics, chemistry, and software engineering taught me that breakthroughs often happen at the intersections.

🇫🇷 First academic event in France since I left 11 years ago — and what a return! The Advanced Quantum Algorithms for Many-Body Systems workshop in Montpellier was fantastic. 🧠 Super sharp, state-of-the-art talks on quantum algorithms for many-body physics and chemistry. 🌿 Breaks in the botanical garden + real French cheese and natural wine… perfect setup for good science. 🤝 Great to catch up with the SEEQA crew, meet new people, and share my poster on Quantum Testability — paper coming soon! Huge thanks to the organisers for such a great event. Feeling inspired to connect more with the quantum community in France!Great meeting you guys ! Aleksei Ivanov, Andreas Juul Bay-Smidt, Fedor Šimkovic, Pietro MartinelloHope to meet you soon again Avner Bensoussan !

I’m particularly excited to explore how Quantum Information Theory can help define a formal notion of Testability in a quantum context—paving the way for more robust and reliable quantum systems.</p> <p>⚡️Looking forward to the next steps!Special thanks to my supervisors Prof. Mohammad Reza Mousavi and Prof. George Booth for their support throughout this journey 🙏.Awesome!

🌟 Reflections on an Amazing Conference: Seeking Quantum Advantage (SeeQa) at Oxford University 🌟 Last week, I had the privilege of attending an incredible conference at Oxford University, focused on the pursuit of Quantum Advantage. The event featured an outstanding lineup of talks from both industry leaders and academic pioneers, highlighting breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum hardware, and cutting-edge theoretical research. The level of expertise shared was truly remarkable! One of the standout moments was the debate evening, held in the mythic Divinity Hall—a setting steeped in history that added even more weight to the discussions. Experts from both academia and industry engaged in thoughtful debates on the ethical implications, scalability, and societal impact of quantum technologies, bridging the gap between theory and real-world implementation. In addition to the stimulating talks, we were treated to a couple of sunny days, perfect for exploring the beautiful Oxford campus. The punting session on the River Cherwell was an absolute blast and a great opportunity to connect with fellow attendees in a more relaxed atmosphere. A huge thank you to the organizers, speakers, and attendees for making this such a memorable experience. The collaboration between academia and industry is accelerating the journey toward quantum advantage, and I’m excited to see where this transformative technology will lead us!Really amazing conference! Big thank you to the organizers! By a large margin this was the best location for a panel discussion ever.
