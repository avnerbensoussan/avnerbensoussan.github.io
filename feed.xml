🇫🇷 First academic event in France since I left 11 years ago — and what a return! The Advanced Quantum Algorithms for Many-Body Systems workshop in Montpellier was fantastic. 🧠 Super sharp, state-of-the-art talks on quantum algorithms for many-body physics and chemistry. 🌿 Breaks in the botanical garden + real French cheese and natural wine… perfect setup for good science. 🤝 Great to catch up with the SEEQA crew, meet new people, and share my poster on Quantum Testability — paper coming soon! Huge thanks to the organisers for such a great event. Feeling inspired to connect more with the quantum community in France!Great meeting you guys ! Aleksei Ivanov, Andreas Juul Bay-Smidt, Fedor Šimkovic, Pietro MartinelloHope to meet you soon again Avner Bensoussan !
